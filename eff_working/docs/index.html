        <h3>
            <em>Eff</em> is a functional language with handlers of not only exceptions,
            but also of other computational effects such as state or I/O.
            With handlers, you can simply implement transactions, redirections, backtracking, multi-threading,
            and much more…

            <h3>Effects are first-class citizens</h3>
            <p>
                <em>Eff</em> is built around a powerful uniform representation of effects,
                which allows you to
                seamlessly combine effects (no <code>do</code>s, no monad transformers),
                override existing effects
                and define your own effects.
            </p>

        <div class="grid-4">
            <h3>Precise control over effects</h3>
            <p>
                <em>Eff</em> infers not only the type of the result, but also the set of all effects that may happen when computing it.
                To boot, handlers allow you to change an effectful computation into one bound to be pure.</a>

            <h3>Strong theoretical foundations</h3>
            <p>
                <em>Eff</em> was built to test the mathematical ideas of algebraic effects in practice.
                Thus, every new feature of <em>Eff</em> is backed by peer-reviewed research.

        The best place to start is to try
            <a href="try">the online version of <em>Eff</em></a>,
        which also comes with a few examples that show the main features of <em>Eff</em>.
        Then, to learn more about the theoretical background, you can read
            <a href="handlers-tutorial.pdf">An Introduction to Algebraic Effects and Handlers</a>.
        When you are ready to get your hands dirty, download the source code,
        which is freely available on <a href="https://github.com/matijapretnar/eff">Github</a>.
